Register yourself below if you'd like to give a lightning talk on Docker Hack day #4, on Thursday May 2.

Good lightning talk topics: how you're using docker; how you plan on using docker; why you think docker is awesome; how docker could be improved; demo of a half-assed prototype of a cool project based on docker; integration of docker with another cool tool.

Bad lightning talk topics: things unrelated to docker.

Lightning talks start at 7:30pm

* Solomon Hykes, Docker roadmap
* Thatcher Peskens, A sneak peek at the public docker index
* Louis Opter, Building dotCloud applications with Docker
* Steeve Morin, Building a complex video processing app with Docker
