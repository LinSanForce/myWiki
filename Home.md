# Engine Project Planning

The Docker follows a **time-based** release process, currently aiming at releasing a new major version every two months. We issue a **code freeze** several weeks before the scheduled release date during which nothing but bugfixes can be added to the release.

Even though the process is time-based, the Docker Engine sets short-term goals for the upcoming release(s). However, time will always win over features: the code freeze will happen regardless of our goals being met.

See the current and past [Engine goals](https://github.com/docker/docker/wiki/Engine-roadmap).
